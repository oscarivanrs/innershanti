                    <h2>Shakti</h2>
                    <h3>Means Light of God</h3>
                    <p>Shakti Is a Naturally gifted Psychic, medium, Healer, Spiritual Teacher, Couples communication therapist, and a Spiritual Ceremonies facilitator.</p>
                    <p>She is also a qualified and certified Emotional Freedom Therapist, Neuro Linguistic Practitioner, Angelic Reiki Practitioner/Master Teacher, Magnified Healing Practitioner and Life Coach Practitioner.</p>
                    <p>Shakti's innate gifts and qualified training allows her to intuitively connect and get to the root cause of her clients problems, thus allowing her to guide them to heal from within, and walk on the true path of peace, harmony, love and light, by giving them the necessary tools.</p>
                    <p>It was through her own journey of sadness, grief, illness and near death experience, that she started looking for answers and guidance, and found the ultimate gift of God, Love, laughter, happiness, Peace and Harmony.</p>
                    <p>It has been through learning how to let go of pain and unwanted baggage, and healing from within, that allows her to understand, empathise and care about each and every one who she meets and works with, at the crossroads of their own journey. It is imperative that we all remember one very important thing, that we always have a choice. once we realise that, you will see that only you are responsible for any emotions you experience, good or bad.</p>
                    <h4>How can she help</h4>
                    <p>Sometimes we don't know what the root cause of our blockage is, which results in, fear, insecurities, lack of self esteem, self worth and self love and sometimes we become bullies and controlling in trying to deal with these issues. Shakti, works 1 to 1 with her clients, helping them to understand and heal of negative and painful issues that keep them stuck, She teaches self-help tools in workshops and also in private to clients, showing them how to reach their true potential, and live the life of Love, laughter, happiness, Peace and Harmony.</p>

                                    I have great pleasure to say that Shakti was a great help to me when I had a big emotional problem 2 years ago. I am a widow, I live on my own, and I needed to talk to somebody who is reliable. Shakti helped me out, and guided me so that I can get on with my life. My problem was very confidential and personal. Shakti handled my problem extremely well. I was guided by Shakti, and will be going abroad with confidence in the near future. Well known in reciting fables to young children in the UK and abroad.

                                            I was at a very low point in my life, when a friend recommended I go and see Shakti, I had not had any experiences of seeing psychics or Mediums before so I thought I would give it a go, I went along with an open mind and didn't really know what to expect.... I didn't know then, that first visit would be the start of a journey to me finding myself, and since then I have not looked back, she is an amazing women who has amazing skills to be able to connect with you and your problems, she has helped me out of my darkest days and if I am here today it is because of her readings and guidance. I'll always be grateful to the angels for bringing Shakti into my life.

                            <p>Would you like to change the way you think about  certain events that have taken place in your life. Learn to let go of unwanted baggage and move on. Sometimes certain events and traumas in our lives leave imprints in our hearts and minds, that don't allow us to move on and live the life we want to, but by realising that our mind is one of the most powerful tools we humans posses, and by reprogramming it, to look at the pictures and stories we create in our mind differently, we can free ourselves, from fear, phobias, trauma, loss, and painful events. Find out how NLP could help you.

                                <p>EFT is a simple, non-intrusive, method of defusing emotional issues and reducing the level of stress most people feel in everyday life. It is a technique developed in the USA by Gary Craig and is now becoming more widely used and taught. It is not hypnotherapy or psychotherapy. EFT can be used regularly on a self-help basis whenever an emotional issue, fear or phobia occurs in your life. EFT works on balancing our emotional & physical energy, some times lifes adverse effects leave us feeling emotionally and physically drained, EFT works on helping one to release negative energy.</p>
                                <p class="fw-bold">How is EFT carried out?</p>
                                <p>By tapping on certain meridian points in the body. Eye movement, humming and an affirmation that will help you release negative energy. This treatment is carried out with the client sitting or lying down fully clothed.</p>
                                <p class="fw-bold">How does EFT work?</p>
                                <p>EFT works by releasing negative energy and blockages.
                                    <br>Simple issues may be cleared with one round of EFT. More complex ones may require repeat rounds with the issue being dealt with from a different perspective each time.</p>

What sets Angelic healing apart from other forms of reiki, is that, Angels, Archangels, Ascended Masters, Galactic Healers and other expressions of the Divine, do the healing directly from the Angelic Kingdom of Light. using the practitioner as a channel between the Angelic Kingdom and client.
                                        <br>Angelic Reiki is a healing energy that brings balance to mind, body and spirit. It encourages the natural healing ability of the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual bodies. Learn how to let go of your stress and learn to love life.</p>

                                    <p>Angelic Reiki session is a real treat for everyone.

                                <p class="fw-bold">What will happen when I learn and practice this meditation?</p>
                                <p>When you learn about the Merkaba in a Flower of Life workshop, you will not only intellectually understand the geometric fields, but you will personally experience them and feel them tangibly around your body. These geometric energy fields around our bodies can be turned on in a particular way, which is also connected to our breath. The Merkaba meditation incorporates a 17-breath process along with mudras (hand positions) that are a key to the correct use of the Merkaba.
                                    <br>Activating the Merkaba through the 17-breath meditation will result in deeper contact with your Higher Self and it will strengthen every aspect of your life. You will be better able to relieve your stress, balance your mind and emotions, and heal yourself if the Merkaba is used often and consistently. Most importantly, you will experience and remember your intimate connection with God in a safe and nurturing environment.</p>

                                    Want to know how to let go of anger and criticism?
                                    She shows couples how to communicate with each other and have what they want, and want what they have. Often we find it easier to tell other people about what is wrong in our relationship, instead of talking to the person we are in the relationship with. Learn how to talk to your partner, with love and respect. without blame, criticism, anger, accusations, but with love and respect.
                                    <br>So many of us try and work out what went wrong after the breakdown of our relationship. Many of us are so deep in our unhappiness that we can't see the wood for the trees, blinded by our pain and unhappiness, often feeling unloved and stuck, and yet still carry a glimmer of hope, that things will work out. We often expect so much from our intimate relationships- support, love friendship, understanding, respect, often we get left feeling hurt and disappointed, when our expectations are not met, we automatically assume, that our partner should know how we are feeling, and yet how can they know.
                                    <br>Communication with each other with love, respect and understanding without blame, anger or criticism, leads to a very healing situation, as we all know that through anger, pain and sheer frustration we say things that leave devastating marks on our relationship, harsh words are like shattered glass, once spoken are very hard to put together again.
                                    <br>Constructive and healing communication is very important especially in difficult times.</p>
