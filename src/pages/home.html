                                I have great pleasure to say that Shakti was a great help to me when I had a big
                                emotional problem 2 years ago. I am a widow, I live on my own, and I needed to talk to
                                somebody who is reliable. Shakti helped me out, and guided me so that I can get on with
                                my life. My problem was very confidential and personal. Shakti handled my problem
                                extremely well. I was guided by Shakti, and will be going abroad with confidence in the
                                near future. Well known in reciting fables to young children in the UK and abroad.

                                            I was at a very low point in my life, when a friend recommended I go and see
                                            Shakti, I had not had any experiences of seeing psychics or Mediums before
                                            so I thought I would give it a go, I went along with an open mind and didn't
                                            really know what to expect.... I didn't know then, that first visit would be
                                            the start of a journey to me finding myself, and since then I have not
                                            looked back, she is an amazing women who has amazing skills to be able to
                                            connect with you and your problems, she has helped me out of my darkest days
                                            and if I am here today it is because of her readings and guidance. I'll
                                            always be grateful to the angels for bringing Shakti into my life.

                                    one of the most powerful tools we humans posses, and by reprogramming it, to look at
                                    the pictures and stories we create in our mind differently, we can free ourselves,
                                    from fear, phobias, trauma, loss, and painful events. Find out how NLP could help

                                <p>EFT is a simple, non-intrusive, method of defusing emotional issues and reducing the
                                    level of stress most people feel in everyday life. It is a technique developed in
                                    the USA by Gary Craig and is now becoming more widely used and taught. It is not
                                    hypnotherapy or psychotherapy. EFT can be used regularly on a self-help basis
                                    whenever an emotional issue, fear or phobia occurs in your life. EFT works on
                                    balancing our emotional & physical energy, some times lifes adverse effects leave us
                                    feeling emotionally and physically drained, EFT works on helping one to release
                                    negative energy.</p>
                                <p class="fw-bold">How is EFT carried out?</p>
                                <p>By tapping on certain meridian points in the body. Eye movement, humming and an
                                    affirmation that will help you release negative energy. This treatment is carried
                                    out with the client sitting or lying down fully clothed.</p>
                                <p class="fw-bold">How does EFT work?</p>
                                <p>EFT works by releasing negative energy and blockages.
                                    <br>Simple issues may be cleared with one round of EFT. More complex ones may
                                    require repeat rounds with the issue being dealt with from a different perspective
                                    each time.

                                        remain dressed and lie or sit comfortably while your practitioner transmits the
                                        energy to you. Even though Angelic Reiki treatment is associated with the laying
                                        on of hands, actual touch is not required. The Angelic Reiki energy can be
                                        powerfully transmitted while the practitioners hold their hands within 1-5
                                        inches above your body in your body's energy field (your aura).

                                    healing was used only in the higher dimensions by Ascended Masters to assist
                                    themselves, the Masters on earth, and mankind under special divine dispensation. In
                                    1992, under the direct intervention and inspiration of Lady Master Kwan Yin,
                                    Magnified Healing® was brought forth by Kathryn Anderson and Gisèle King into its

                                    <br>In most vibrational healing methods, the healing is channeled and directed
                                    through the healer, in Magnified Healing® the practitioner creates the energy with
                                    GOD MOST HIGH OF THE UNIVERSE and becomes Magnified Healing®.

                                    incorporates all aspects of healing - physical, emotional, mental, etheric and
                                    spiritual. Using sacred geometries, breathing and affirmations allowing the student

                                <p class="fw-bold">What will happen when I learn and practice this meditation?</p>
                                <p>When you learn about the Merkaba in a Flower of Life workshop, you will not only
                                    intellectually understand the geometric fields, but you will personally experience
                                    them and feel them tangibly around your body. These geometric energy fields around
                                    our bodies can be turned on in a particular way, which is also connected to our
                                    breath. The Merkaba meditation incorporates a 17-breath process along with mudras
                                    (hand positions) that are a key to the correct use of the Merkaba.
                                    <br>Activating the Merkaba through the 17-breath meditation will result in deeper
                                    contact with your Higher Self and it will strengthen every aspect of your life. You
                                    will be better able to relieve your stress, balance your mind and emotions, and heal
                                    yourself if the Merkaba is used often and consistently. Most importantly, you will
                                    experience and remember your intimate connection with God in a safe and nurturing
                                    environment.

                                    want what they have. Often we find it easier to tell other people about what is
                                    wrong in our relationship, instead of talking to the person we are in the
                                    relationship with. Learn how to talk to your partner, with love and respect. without

                                    <br>So many of us try and work out what went wrong after the breakdown of our
                                    relationship. Many of us are so deep in our unhappiness that we can't see the wood
                                    for the trees, blinded by our pain and unhappiness, often feeling unloved and stuck,
                                    and yet still carry a glimmer of hope, that things will work out. We often expect so
                                    much from our intimate relationships- support, love friendship, understanding,
                                    respect, often we get left feeling hurt and disappointed, when our expectations are
                                    not met, we automatically assume, that our partner should know how we are feeling,
                                    and yet how can they know.
                                    <br>Communication with each other with love, respect and understanding without
                                    blame, anger or criticism, leads to a very healing situation, as we all know that
                                    through anger, pain and sheer frustration we say things that leave devastating marks
                                    on our relationship, harsh words are like shattered glass, once spoken are very hard
                                    to put together again.
